Implementing antimatter reactors by the standard Star Trek supplies.
Concept:
  - Deuterium (matter) and Antideuterium (antimatter) are mixed in a combustionchamber in a controlled reaction and produce plasma which is used as the  power source of the ship.
  - the reaction is controlled through use of a dilitihium  reactor
  - more matter than antimatter is used in the reaction
  - Deuterium and antimatter have to be stored separately to avoid spontaneous, destructive reaction
  - dilithium is (canonwise) a rare material only found sparesly throughout the galaxy. it can not be artificially created.
  
Questions to answer before development:
  - can dilithium crystals expire/run out after a certain amount of usage?
  - is antimatter unstable and dangerous to handle? if so, can battle damage set it off?

    
Side effects:
    - if deuterium and antimatter spontaneously react when stored togehter, makeshift bombs can be created where logic feeds two storages together with deuterium and antimatter.
    - in canon, warpcores can be ejected which offers more funky ways to use it:
      "As a safety precaution, the core could be physically ejected from the ship, should an event such as a catastrophic containment failure of the matter-antimatter
      reaction occur that could not be corrected. There were also some tactical uses for ejecting and detonating a core on purpose. The detonation could, for example,
      be used to neutralize the cascade of a subspace tear or to push a ship away from the gravity well of a black hole."
    - assuming that loading/unloading the dilithium crystal into the reactors crystal slot cant be fully automated, the reactor core will have to be accessible for a player.
    - if warpcores explode after critical failure, a big explosion could be added after a ship overheated, instead of just deleting it. Would benefit immersion.
